## Database Recommendation

For a patient management system, I recommend starting with MySQL.

In healthcare, accuracy is the most important factor. If a doctor updates a patient’s allergy list, that information must be saved perfectly and visible to everyone else immediately. MySQL uses a system called ACID, which is basically a "perfectionist" approach to data. It ensures that every change is either 100% completed or not done at all, preventing half-finished or messy records. In terms of the CAP Theorem, MySQL focuses on Consistency. This means every user sees the exact same data at the exact same time, which is critical for patient safety.

However, if the startup adds a fraud detection module, my recommendation would change to a "hybrid" approach using MongoDB for that specific part.

Fraud detection involves looking at thousands of tiny details—like where a person is logging in from or how fast they are clicking—to spot a hacker. This creates a massive "firehose" of data that changes constantly. MongoDB is built for this. It follows the BASE model, which focuses on being Available and fast rather than perfectly consistent every microsecond. It allows the database to grow (scale) easily by adding more servers. Because MongoDB doesn't require a strict "table" layout, engineers can add new types of tracking data without having to redesign the whole database.

In short: I would use MySQL to keep the patient's medical records safe and organized, and MongoDB to handle the high-speed, messy data needed to catch fraudsters.
